# Write a python program to create a tuple of numbers and print one item.

# Creating a tuple of numbers
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Print one specific item from the tuple
# Let's print the item at index 3 (the fourth item, considering zero-based indexing)
item_to_print = numbers[3]

# Displaying the result
print(f"The item at index 3 in the tuple is: {item_to_print}")
